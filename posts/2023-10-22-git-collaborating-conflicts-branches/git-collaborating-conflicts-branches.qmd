## Setting up pulling

Everyone should run in the terminal from your project directory,

```
git config pull.rebase false
```

or from any directory

```
git config --global pull.rebase false
```


## Plan for the day

These are things I want to do today.

1. Create a conflict
2. Resolve conflict
3. Create branch
4. Update branch
5. Conflict on a branch
6. Pull requests

## What I've done

I've completed steps 1-3 and I'm about to do step 4.
