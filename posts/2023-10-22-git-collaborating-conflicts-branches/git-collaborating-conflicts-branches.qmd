## Plan for the day

These are things I want to do today.
Here is the plan.

1. Create a conflict
2. Resolve conflict
3. Create branch
4. Update branch
5. Conflict on a branch
6. Pull requests


## Setting up pulling

Everyone should run in the terminal from your project directory,

```
git config pull.rebase true
```

or from any directory

```
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

## Steps to rebase

1. Commit changes
2. Pull changes (Done if there are no conflicts)
3. Fix conflicts
4. Commit changes
5. Run `git rebase --continue` in the Terminal.
6. Push
